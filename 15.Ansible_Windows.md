### Documentation <a name="Documentation"></a>

#### 01.With Ansible’s native Windows support: <a name="Documentation1"></a>
- Gather facts on Windows hosts
- Install and uninstall MSIs
- Enable and disable Windows features
- Start, stop, and manage Windows services
- Create and manage local users and groups
- Manage Windows packages via the Chocolatey package manager ( https://chocolatey.org/)
- Manage and install Windows updates
- Fetch files from remote sites
- Push and execute any PowerShell scripts you write

Note: *Modules for Windows are prefixed with win_, except for the setup module*

Resource for usecase: https://docs.ansible.com/ansible/latest/os_guide/windows_usage.html

```
- name: Manage tools directory
  win_file:
    path: 'C:/Tools'
    state: directory

```

#### 02. Microsoft Windows automation – managed node prerequisites: <a name="Documentation2"></a>

- The Microsoft Windows machine should be installed and configured with the following items: 
  + PowerShell 3.0 or newer (some of the Ansible modules for Microsoft Windows may require newer versions of PowerShell; refer to the module documentation you use)
  + .NET 4.0 or newer.
  + A WinRM listener should be created and activated – Ansible uses WinRM to connect to the Microsoft Windows machines by default. Microsoft Windows Remote Management is a SOAPbased remote management protocol that communicates over HTTP or HTTPS.
  + A Microsoft Windows firewall should be configured to allow traffic on 5985 (HTTP) and/or5986 (HTTPS). If there is additional firewall or network traffic control between the Ansible control node and Microsoft Windows machines, then make sure the ports are allowed there too.


#### 03. Ansible connection variables <a name="Documentation3"></a>
