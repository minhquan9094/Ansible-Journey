# Ansible Plugin

- Ansible plugins are small pieces of code that help to enable a flexible and expandable architecture. You have Ansible executable, and add plugins as needed for other features and capabilities like any other software. There are different types of plugins in Ansible such as connection plugins, action plugins, become plugins, and inventory plugins. For example, the default connection plugin you will be using is called ssh, and it is possible to use connection plugins called docker or buildah

# Ansible Module

- An Ansible module is a piece of reusable and standalone script that can be used to achieve some specific tasks. Modules provide a defined interface with options to accept arguments and return information to Ansible in JSON format. Ansible modules: ping/yum/apt. Modules excuted on Control node
- Some method to access manage node: network_cli, netconf, and httpapi.


# Ansible Collector
- Library for each module

# Ansible Playbook

- The Ansible playbook is a simple file written in YAML format with the instruction list of automation
tasks.

# Ansible roles
- Ansible roles allow you to develop reusable automation components by grouping and encapsulating related automation artifacts, like configuration files, templates, tasks, and handlers.
- An Ansible role is a collection of tasks, handlers, templates, and variables for configuring the target system so that it meets the desired state. Ansible roles enable content sharing without much trouble as we can include the required variables, tasks, templates, and other files in the role directory itself. Ansible roles are meant for reusability and collaborative support in such a way that the same roles can be distributed to teams or the public. Other users can use the roles to achieve the same task:
* With Ansible roles, we can easily share a playbook’s content with other teams by sharing the entire role directory. For example, it is possible to write a role for install_dbserver or setup_webserver and later share it with the public/other teams.
* Larger projects can be created in a modular way.
* Different users can create different roles in parallel and share the same project. For example, developer 1 writes a role for install_dbserver and developer 2 focuses on the setup_webserver role.
